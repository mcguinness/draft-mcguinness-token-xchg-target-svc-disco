           OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange Target Service Discovery
          draft-mcguinness-token-xchg-target-svc-disco-latest

Abstract

   This specification defines a method for OAuth 2.0 clients to discover
   the set of available target services (audiences, resources, and
   scopes) for a given subject token when performing OAuth 2.0 Token
   Exchange.  The discovery endpoint accepts any subject token type
   registered in the OAuth Token Type Registry and returns values that
   are valid inputs to subsequent Token Exchange requests, supporting
   advanced use cases such as identity chaining and cross-domain
   delegation.

1.  Introduction

   OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange [RFC8693] enables a client to present a
   token issued in one security domain to an Authorization Server and
   securely trade it for a new token issued for another domain.  The
   exchanged token is minted with the target server’s token
   requirements, including its own audience, resource indicators, and
   scopes, so it becomes valid and enforceable for the desired
   downstream service.  This enables controlled cross-domain access,
   removes the confused-deputy problem by ensuring tokens are explicitly
   targeted to the correct service, and avoids requiring direct trust
   between the original token issuer and the target service.

   Authorization Servers may be capable of issuing tokens to multiple
   services for a given subject token and client, but the client must
   already know which values it may request.  Today, this knowledge is
   typically provided through static configuration, proprietary APIs, or
   informal documentation, leading to brittle integrations and
   unnecessary Token Exchange failures, particularly when subjects are
   authorized to access only a subset of available services.

   This specification defines the OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange Target
   Service Discovery Endpoint, a standardized mechanism that enables
   clients to dynamically discover the set of available Token Exchange
   targets (audiences, resources, and scopes) for a given subject token.
   The authorization server evaluates both the subject token and the
   client's permissions and returns only the values the client is
   authorized to request.

   This extension is especially valuable in scenarios requiring identity
   chaining and cross-domain authorization:

   *  Progressive token exchange across service boundaries, such as
      multi-tier microservices architectures and delegated flows where
      tokens must be exchanged with narrower or transformed permissions
      at each hop.  In these scenarios, discovery is critical because
      the set of available downstream services and their required
      permissions vary based on the subject token's context and the
      client's authorization.  The permission narrowing at each service
      hop means that static configuration cannot accommodate these per-
      subject and per-client variations, leading to integration failures
      when clients attempt token exchanges for services the subject is
      not authorized to access.

   *  Cross-boundary deployments where downstream services exist in
      separate administrative, organizational, or cloud domains
      requiring strict control over token issuance and acceptance.
      Unlike progressive token exchange which focuses on permission
      transformation within a single domain, this scenario addresses the
      challenge of discovering available target services across distinct
      trust boundaries where authorization policies are independently
      managed.  Discovery is essential here because authorization
      policies and available target services change dynamically across
      these boundaries, and static configuration cannot reflect real-
      time policy decisions or account for varying permissions across
      different administrative domains.

   *  Single Sign-On (SSO) to API flows, such as those enabled by the
      Identity Assertion Authorization Grant (ID-JAG)
      [I-D.oauth-identity-assertion-authz-grant], where a client needs
      to seamlessly connect to cross-domain resources and act on behalf
      of the user to access APIs

   This specification provides the following benefits:

   *  *Dynamic Discovery*: Eliminates static configuration requirements
      by enabling clients to discover available target services at
      runtime, reducing integration failures and improving developer
      experience.

   *  *Standardization*: Provides a standardized discovery mechanism,
      replacing proprietary APIs and improving interoperability across
      OAuth 2.0 implementations.

   *  *Real-Time Authorization*: Returns target services based on real-
      time policy evaluation, client permissions, and subject token
      context, ensuring accurate and up-to-date authorization
      information.  This enables per-subject and per-client results,
      which is essential when the set of available target services
      varies by user or client.  Static configurations cannot
      accommodate these per-subject or per-client variations.

3.  Token Exchange Target Service Discovery Endpoint

   This specification defines a new endpoint for OAuth 2.0 Authorization
   Servers that enables clients to discover the set of available target
   services (audiences, resources, and scopes) for a given subject token
   when performing OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange [RFC8693].

   The endpoint is identified by the Authorization Server metadata
   parameter token_exchange_target_service_discovery_endpoint, as
   defined in Section 7.

3.1.  Endpoint Request

   The client makes a request to the token exchange target service
   discovery endpoint by sending an HTTP POST request to the endpoint
   URL.  The client MUST use TLS as specified in Section 1.6 of
   [RFC6749].

   The endpoint URL MUST be obtained from the Authorization Server's
   metadata document [RFC8414] using the
   token_exchange_target_service_discovery_endpoint parameter.  The
   endpoint URL is an absolute URL as defined by [RFC3986].

   The client sends the parameters using the application/x-www-form-
   urlencoded format per Appendix B of [RFC6749].  Character encoding
   MUST be UTF-8 as specified in Appendix B of [RFC6749].  If a
   parameter is included more than once in the request, the
   authorization server MUST return an error response with the error
   code invalid_request as described in Section 2.2.

3.1.1.  Request Parameters

   The following parameters are used in the request:

   subject_token  REQUIRED.  The subject token used as input to
      discovery.  The token type is indicated by the subject_token_type
      parameter.

   subject_token_type  REQUIRED.  A string value containing a URI, as
      described in Section 5 of [RFC8693], that indicates the type of
      the subject_token parameter.  This identifier MUST be a valid URI,
      as defined in [RFC3986], and SHOULD be registered in the "OAuth
      Token Type Registry" as defined in Section 5.1 of [RFC8693].

   The client MAY include additional parameters as defined by extensions
   and the authorization server MUST ignore unknown parameters.

   Client authentication MAY be required by the authorization server.
   The means of client authentication are defined by the authorization
   server and MAY include any method supported by the authorization
   server, including those defined in Section 2.3 of [RFC6749].  If
   client authentication is required by the authorization server but not
   provided in the request, the authorization server MUST return an
   error response with the error code invalid_client as described in
   Section 2.2.

3.1.2.  Subject Token Processing

   The authorization server MUST process the subject_token parameter
   according to the following rules:

   1.  The authorization server MUST validate that the subject_token and
       subject_token_type parameters are not empty strings.  If either
       parameter is an empty string, the authorization server MUST
       return an error response with the error code invalid_request as
       described in Section 2.2.

   2.  The authorization server MUST validate that the
       subject_token_type parameter is a valid URI per the URI
       validation requirements specified in Section 2.1.2.  If the
       format is invalid (e.g., not a valid absolute URI or URN), the
       authorization server MUST return an error response with the error
       code invalid_request as described in Section 2.2.

   3.  The authorization server MUST determine whether it supports the
       indicated token type.  This determination is an implementation
       decision and MAY be based on the authorization server's
       capabilities, the subject_token value, the authenticated client,
       or any combination thereof.  If the subject_token_type is not
       supported by the authorization server for the given context, the
       authorization server MUST return an error response with the error
       code unsupported_token_type as described in Section 2.2.

   4.  The authorization server MUST validate the subject_token
       according to the rules for the indicated token type.  The
       validation process MUST verify:

       *  The token is properly formatted for the indicated token type

       *  The token's signature (if applicable) is valid and can be
          verified using the appropriate cryptographic keys

       *  The token was issued by a trusted issuer

       *  The token has not expired

       *  The token has not been revoked

       *  The token is associated with the authenticated client, if
          client authentication is required

   5.  If the subject_token is invalid for any reason (e.g., malformed,
       expired, revoked, or does not match the subject_token_type), the
       authorization server MUST return an error response with the error
       code invalid_request as described in Section 2.2.

   6.  The authorization server MUST evaluate the subject_token in
       conjunction with the authenticated client's permissions to
       determine which target services are available for discovery.  The
       specific authorization policy evaluation mechanism is
       implementation-specific and MAY be based on scopes, claims,
       resource-based access control, or other authorization models.
       When constructing the response, the authorization server MUST
       omit any target service objects or properties that would contain
       empty strings, as specified in Section 2.1.2.

3.1.3.  Request Example

   The following is an example of a discovery request:

   POST /target-discovery HTTP/1.1
   Host: as.example.com
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   subject_token=SlAV32hkKG...ACCESSTOKEN...
   &subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token

3.2.  Endpoint Response

   The authorization server validates the request and returns a response
   with the discovery results.  The response MUST use the application/
   json media type as specified in [RFC7159].  The Content-Type header
   of the response MUST be set to application/json.

   The authorization server MAY include HTTP cache validators (such as
   ETag or Last-Modified headers) and expiration times (such as Cache-
   Control or Expires headers) in the response to enable conditional
   requests by the client, as specified in Section 13 of [RFC2616].

3.2.1.  Successful Response

   If the request is valid and authorized, the authorization server
   returns a JSON object containing a supported_targets property.  The
   supported_targets property is an array of available token exchange
   targets.  Each element in the array represents a target service that
   the client is authorized to request in a subsequent token exchange
   operation.

   Each target service object contains the following properties:

   audience  REQUIRED.  A string value containing an absolute URI
      indicating an available audience value for token exchange, as
      defined in Section 2.1 of [RFC8693].  Empty strings are not
      supported and the response MUST contain an URI.  If the audience
      value is a URI but not a URL (e.g., a URN) and does not provide a
      location, the authorization server SHOULD return a resource
      property that contains a location.

   resource  OPTIONAL.  A string value containing an absolute URI, or an
      array of string values each containing a URI, indicating available
      resource indicator values, as defined in Section 2 of [RFC8707].
      In JSON, URI values are represented as strings.  Empty strings are
      not supported.  If present as a string, the string MUST contain a
      non-empty URI.  If present as an array, the array MUST contain at
      least one non-empty URI string and MUST NOT be empty.  If no
      resources are available for a target service, this property MUST
      be omitted from the response rather than including an empty
      string, empty array, or null value.

   scope  OPTIONAL.  A string value containing a space-delimited list of
      OAuth 2.0 scope values, as defined in Section 3.3 of [RFC6749],
      that are available for this target service.  Each individual scope
      value in the list MUST conform to the scope syntax defined in
      Section 3.3 of [RFC6749].  Empty strings are not supported.  If
      the property is present, the string MUST contain at least one non-
      empty scope value.  If no scopes are available for a target
      service, this property MUST be omitted from the response rather
      than including an empty string.  The authorization server
      determines which scopes to return based on its authorization
      policy evaluation, which is implementation-specific.  The scopes
      returned SHOULD be those that would be authorized in a subsequent
      token exchange request per Section 2.2 of [RFC8693].

   supported_token_types  OPTIONAL.  An array of strings indicating the
      token types that may be requested for this target service in a
      subsequent token exchange operation.  Each string MUST be a valid
      absolute URI, as defined in [RFC3986].  Empty strings are not
      supported; array elements MUST contain non-empty URI strings.  If
      the array would be empty or contain only empty strings, this
      property MUST be omitted from the response.  If omitted, the
      client may use any token type supported by the authorization
      server.

   Extensions to this specification MAY define additional properties for
   the response object or for target service objects.  Clients MUST
   ignore any properties they do not understand.

   Multiple target service objects for the same audience MAY be returned
   with different resource(s) and scopes.  The combination of audience
   and resource (the entire set of resources, when present) MUST be
   unique within the supported_targets array.  That is, no two objects
   in the supported_targets array may have both the same audience value
   and the same set of resource values (when comparing arrays, the order
   of elements does not matter, but the complete set must match).

   If no target services are available for the given subject token and
   client, the authorization server returns a JSON object with an empty
   supported_targets array: {"supported_targets": []}.

3.2.2.  Response Example

   The following is an example of a successful discovery response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "supported_targets": [
  {
    "audience": "https://api.example.com",
    "resource": ["https://api.example.com/orders", "https://api.example.com/inventory"],
    "scope": "orders.read inventory.read",
    "supported_token_types": [
      "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token"
    ]
  },
  {
    "audience": "https://billing.provider.example",
    "scope": "customer.read customer.write",
    "supported_token_types": [
      "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt-bearer"
    ]
  },
  {
    "audience": "https://backend-audit-service.example.com",
    "scope": "audit.read audit.write",
    "supported_token_types": [
      "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token"
    ]
  }
  ]
}

3.3.  Error Response

   If the request failed, the authorization server returns an error
   response as defined in Section 5.2 of [RFC6749].  The response MUST
   use the application/json media type, and the Content-Type header MUST
   be set to application/json.  The HTTP status code MUST be set
   according to the error code, as specified below and in Section 5.2 of
   [RFC6749].  The following error codes may be returned:

   invalid_request  The request is missing a required parameter,
      includes an invalid parameter value (such as an invalid URI format
      for subject_token_type or an empty string for subject_token or
      subject_token_type), includes a parameter more than once, or is
      otherwise malformed.  This error code is also returned when the
      provided subject token is invalid, expired, revoked, or does not
      match the subject token type, or when another error condition
      occurred during token validation.  The HTTP status code MUST be
      400 (Bad Request).

   invalid_client  Client authentication failed (e.g., unknown client,
      no client authentication included when required, or unsupported
      authentication method).  This error code MUST be returned when
      client authentication is required by the authorization server but
      not provided in the request.  The HTTP status code MUST be 401
      (Unauthorized).

   unauthorized_client  The authenticated client is not authorized to
      use this discovery endpoint.  The HTTP status code MUST be 403
      (Forbidden).

   unsupported_token_type  The authorization server does not support the
      subject token type indicated by the subject_token_type parameter.
      The HTTP status code MUST be 400 (Bad Request).

   invalid_scope  The request includes an invalid scope parameter.  The
      HTTP status code MUST be 400 (Bad Request).

   server_error  The authorization server encountered an unexpected
      condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.  The HTTP
      status code MUST be 500 (Internal Server Error).

   temporarily_unavailable  The authorization server is currently unable
      to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or
      maintenance of the server.  The HTTP status code MUST be 503
      (Service Unavailable).

3.3.1.  Error Response Example

   The following is an example of an error response:

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "error": "invalid_request",
     "error_description": "The subject token is invalid or expired"
   }

4.  Example

   This example demonstrates a complete cross-domain identity chaining
   workflow using the token exchange target service discovery endpoint.

4.1.  Step 1: Discover Target Services

   The client begins with a subject access token issued by Domain A and
   calls the target service discovery endpoint to learn which target
   services are available.

4.1.1.  Discovery Request

POST https://as.domainA.example/target-discovery HTTP/1.1
Host: as.domainA.example
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=client-A
&client_assertion_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer
&client_assertion=eyJhbGciOi...
&subject_token=SlAV32hkKG...ACCESSTOKEN...
&subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token

4.1.2.  Discovery Response

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "supported_targets": [
  {
    "audience": "https://api.domainB.example",
    "resource": ["https://api.domainB.example/orders", "https://api.domainB.example/inventory"],
    "scope": "orders.read inventory.read",
    "supported_token_types": [
      "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt-bearer"
    ]
  }
  ]
}

   From this response, the client learns that it may request a token
   exchange for the audience https://api.domainB.example with the
   resources https://api.domainB.example/orders and
   https://api.domainB.example/inventory and the scopes orders.read and
   inventory.read.  The client also learns that JWT bearer tokens are
   supported for this target service.

4.2.  Step 2: Discover Token Types (Optional)

   If the discovery response does not include supported_token_types, or
   if the client needs to verify token type support, the client may
   query the Authorization Server Metadata of Domain B to determine
   which token types are supported for the target service.

4.2.1.  Metadata Request

GET https://as.domainB.example/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server HTTP/1.1
Host: as.domainB.example

4.2.2.  Metadata Response

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "issuer": "https://as.domainB.example",
     "token_endpoint": "https://as.domainB.example/token",
     "requested_token_types_supported": [
       "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt-bearer"
     ]
   }

   This confirms that Domain B supports JWT bearer tokens as a requested
   token type.

4.3.  Step 3: Perform Token Exchange

   The client now performs a token exchange with Domain A's token
   endpoint, requesting a JWT for Domain B using the values discovered
   in the previous steps.

4.3.1.  Token Exchange Request

   POST https://as.domainA.example/token HTTP/1.1
   Host: as.domainA.example
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange
   &subject_token=SlAV32hkKG...ACCESSTOKEN...
   &subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token
   &requested_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt-bearer
   &audience=https://api.domainB.example
   &resource=https://api.domainB.example/orders
   &resource=https://api.domainB.example/inventory
   &scope=orders.read inventory.read

4.3.2.  Token Exchange Response

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "access_token": "eyJraWQiOi...DOMAINB.JWT...",
     "issued_token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt-bearer",
     "token_type": "N_A",
     "expires_in": 3600,
     "scope": "orders.read inventory.read"
   }

   The client now holds a Domain B-scoped JWT token that can be used to
   access the target service, derived from Domain A's access token
   through the token exchange process.

5.  Authorization Server Metadata

   This specification defines the following authorization server
   metadata [RFC8414] parameter to enable clients to discover the token
   exchange target service discovery endpoint:

   token_exchange_target_service_discovery_endpoint  URL of the token
      exchange target service discovery endpoint.  This URL MUST use the
      https scheme.  The authorization server SHOULD publish this
      metadata value.

   The following is a non-normative example of the metadata:

{
  "issuer": "https://as.example.com",
  "token_exchange_target_service_discovery_endpoint": "https://as.example.com/target-discovery"
}

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Subject Token Validation

   The authorization server MUST validate the subject token provided in
   the request.  The validation process MUST verify that:

   *  The subject token is valid and not expired

   *  The subject token type matches the subject_token_type parameter

   *  The subject token is associated with the authenticated client (if
      client authentication is required)

   *  The subject token has not been revoked

   If any validation fails, the authorization server MUST return an
   invalid_request error as described in Section 2.2.

6.2.  Client Authentication

   The authorization server SHOULD require client authentication for the
   discovery endpoint to prevent unauthorized access to authorization
   information.  The authorization server MUST support at least one of
   the client authentication methods defined in Section 2.3 of
   [RFC6749].  If client authentication is required but not provided,
   the authorization server MUST return an error response with the error
   code invalid_client as described in Section 2.2.

6.3.  Authorization Policy Enforcement

   The authorization server MUST evaluate both the subject token and the
   client's permissions when determining which target services to
   return.  The server MUST only return target services that the client
   is authorized to request in a subsequent token exchange operation.
   The specific authorization policy evaluation mechanism is
   implementation-specific and MAY be based on scopes, claims, resource-
   based access control, attribute-based access control, or other
   authorization models supported by the authorization server.

6.4.  Information Disclosure

   The discovery endpoint reveals information about which target
   services are available for a given subject token and client.  This
   information could be used by an attacker to enumerate authorization
   relationships.  To mitigate this risk:

   *  The authorization server SHOULD require client authentication

   *  The authorization server SHOULD apply rate limiting to prevent
      enumeration attacks

   *  The authorization server MAY return different results based on the
      authenticated client to limit information disclosure

   *  The authorization server SHOULD log access to the discovery
      endpoint for security monitoring

6.5.  Token Confidentiality

   The subject token is transmitted in the request.  The authorization
   server MUST require the use of TLS as specified in Section 1.6 of
   [RFC6749] to protect the token in transit.

6.6.  Error Handling

   The authorization server MUST NOT provide detailed error messages
   that could aid an attacker in understanding the authorization
   server's internal state or policies.  Error responses SHOULD be
   generic and not reveal specific information about why a request
   failed beyond what is necessary for the client to correct the
   request.

7.  Privacy Considerations

   The discovery endpoint returns information about authorization
   relationships between subjects, clients, and target services.  This
   information may be considered privacy-sensitive, as it reveals:

   *  Which target services a subject is authorized to access

   *  The scope of permissions available for each target service

   *  The existence of authorization relationships

   To protect privacy:

   *  The authorization server SHOULD only return information that the
      authenticated client is authorized to know

   *  The authorization server SHOULD apply the principle of least
      privilege when determining which target services to return

   *  The authorization server SHOULD log access to the discovery
      endpoint in accordance with applicable privacy regulations

   *  The authorization server MAY provide mechanisms for subjects to
      control or limit the information returned by the discovery
      endpoint

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  OAuth Authorization Server Metadata Registry

   This specification registers the following value in the IANA "OAuth
   Authorization Server Metadata" registry [RFC8414] established by
   [RFC8414].

   Metadata Name: token_exchange_target_service_discovery_endpoint

   Metadata Description: URL of the token exchange target service
   discovery endpoint
